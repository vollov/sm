version 0.1 - one user can own/join one store only
[1] login


[2] menu options after login:

v1 user can be either a owner or sales:

after login
if user.is_superuser(), goto /admin
if user is owner: show [store, product, enroll sales] as edit  /store/owner/{store_id}  owner_profile
if user is user: show add store, product(read), order(edit), /store/sales/{store_id}  sales_profile
if user is neither registered or isOwner, show add store.    /store/user default_profile

TODO: v2 a user can be both owner or sales
=======================
in Login view, use ProfileHelper to decide user role:

if user.is_superuser(), goto /admin
if user are both owner and sales: need select store(drop down) and role (owner, sales) , goto /account/switch-role
if user is owner: show [store, product, enroll sales] as edit  /store/owner/{store_id}  owner_profile
if user is user: show add store, product(read), order(edit), /store/sales/{store_id}  sales_profile
if user is neither registered or isOwner, show add store.    /store/none default_profile

/store/edit/:store_id edit
/store/user/user_id/list/  list store_list
/store/new create

[3] Action and DB table mapping

1) user join a store as sales: add an item in sales_store table
2) user create a store: add user.id in store.owner field



steps
==================
1) user profile model
2) user profile admin
3) registration
4) login


url design:

1) store_id stored in session, current menu stored in session? how to decide menu for each page? 

============================================
[1]sales
/sales/customer/new/{store_id}
/sales/customers/{store_id}
